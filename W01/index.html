    <h1>Jared Ellis</h1>
    <h2>A Web Experience</h2>
    <p>My name is Jared Ellis, I am 23 years old. I am currently in the Software Engineering program.
    My hobbies include making obscure pop-culture references (The Office isn't obscure, don't @ me),
    sailing and other ocean based activities, and cooking. I have no children nor grandchildren that I'm 
    aware of. Currently, I am working as a tutor coordinator for the campus CSE/CIT drop in lab.</p>
    <p>I'm not really sure what other hints to my bank accounts I want to give away, so here's a picture of me.</p>

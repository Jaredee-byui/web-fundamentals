          <h3>What makes a sandwich?</h3>
          <p>
            Traditionally, a sandwich is defined as any food afixed between two
            slices of bread. By extension, a grilled cheese sandwich is any type
            of cheese betwixt two pieces of bread. As such, grilled cheese
            sandwiches are pretty flexible with their composition and
            ingredients.

          <h3>Some ideas about grilled cheeses</h3>
          <p>
            The grilled cheese is a rather conceptual sandwich, there's no one true way to make a grilled cheese but there's plenty of
            ways to no make a grilled cheese. As such, consider the following:
          </p>
          <img src="images/waldemar-brandt-kPqaqug998Y-unsplash.jpg" alt="some cheese wheels">
          <ul>
            <li>Always use a melting cheese, not all cheeses are the same, and some melt better than others.</li>
            <li>Use the right bread, some breads toast better than others. Breads with a high oil content will likely have better results.</li>
            <li>Grease the pan! Butter, grease, oil, mayo, doesn't matter. Just have some oil to cooke with!</li>
            <li>Low and slow, cook the sandwich at a low temp with a lid to ensure proper cheese melting.</li>
            <li>A neglectful man is a man with no sandwich. Keep an eye on it while it's cooking!</li>
            <li>Condiments are a nice addon, but the cheese should always be the star of the show.</li>
            <li>Side it up, a bowl of soup takes your grilled cheese to a new level of good.</li>
          </ul>

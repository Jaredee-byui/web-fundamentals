      <h3>Normal paragraph example</h3>
      <p>
        The Grilled Cheese Sandwich: The Grilled Cheese Sandwich is a type of
        sandwich which consists of two slices of sandwich bread with a layer of
        cheese in the middle. Traditionally, the sandwich is then cooked in a
        pan or on a griddle with butter or another type of oil until the cheese
        has been melted and the bread sufficently browned.
      </p>
      <h3>Colored paragraph example</h3>
      <p class="colored">
        While there is no one true way to make a grilled cheese sandwich, there
        are some important distinctions to make between it and other types of
        hot sandwiches. Grilled cheese sandwiches only have one interal
        structural ingredient: cheese. While condiments such as mayo or mustard
        can be included within the sandwich, items such as sandwich meats or
        vegtables cannot be included while also maintaining the grilled cheese
        sandwich taxonomy.
